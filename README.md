# Introduction #
CuteFF is just a webpage where I show off my Twitterian FollowFridays. A bunch of people I like and that you should follow. It comes with a "nice" design in the form of a terminal-like display feature.

# How it works #
Kinda not-that-easy-to-update: input the usernames in the array in ff.js, replace the intro and outro text with what you want, and upload.
